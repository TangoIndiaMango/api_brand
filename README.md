# Backend - Brand API

## Setting up the Backend

### Install Dependencies

1. **Python 3.7** - Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

2. **Virtual Environment** - We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

3. **PIP Dependencies** - Once your virtual environment is setup and running, install the required dependencies by navigating to the `/BrandApi` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Key Pip Dependencies

- [Django](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a backend framework. Django is required to handle requests and responses.

- [cloudinary_storage](https://cloudinary.com/) is the storage to store user uploads. 

- 

### Using Django default Database


- Add to settings.py
```bash
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
    }
}

```

Populate the database using the `python manage.py makemigrations`

```bash
- python manage.py makemigrations
- python manage.py migrate
```

### Run the Server

From within the `./src` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## To Do Tasks

These are the files:

1. `django_brand/customer/`
2. `django_brand/django_brand/ --contains the default setup provided by django`
2. `django_brand/gateway/`
2. `django_brand/user/`

One note before you delve into each endpoint, 

### Endpoints
